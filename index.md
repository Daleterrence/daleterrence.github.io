# Mission Quickies
#### **Currently a work-in-progress**, expect incomplete info, maybe go use a wiki for now. 

To-the-point, no bullshit guides for every mission in the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI. You won't find any extra crap here like sidequests, lore, optional dialogue, etc.

These guides expect you to be at Level 99 for ease of completion, and aware of how to make use of Home Points, Survival Guides, Unity warps, etc. Fights will only be explained if resembling a challenge to a Level 99 player.
